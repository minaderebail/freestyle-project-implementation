    <h2>Comparison of Economic Indicators</h2>

    <h4>Economic theories about the relationships between these indicators: </h4>
    <p> </p>
    <h6>Inflation & interest rates:</h6>
    <p> "These tend to move together because the Federal 
        Reserve changes interest rates to manage inflation. Lowering interest rates 
        essentially increases the money supply, which helps stimulate the economy, 
        while raising interest rates stifles the economy."

    </p> 
    <h6>Inflation & treasury yield rates:</h6>
    <p> "Treasury yield rates rise with inflation 
        in order to make up for the loss in purchasing power. Essentially, when inflation 
        exists, treasury yields become higher, as fixed income products are not as in-demand."

    </p> 
    <h6>Inflation & unemployment rates:</h6>
    <p> "Inflation & unemployment typically have an inverse correlation. 
        In times of high unemployment, wages remain stagnant, so there is no wage inflation. 
        In times of low unemployment, employers typically need to pay higher wages to attract employees, 
        ultimately leading to rising wage inflation. "

    </p>
    <h6>Interest & treasury yield rates:</h6>
    <p> "Treasury yield rates are essentially a reflection 
        of market interest rates, meaning they move in tandem."
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/122203.asp" target="_blank">[Read more here]</a>
    </p>
    <h6>Interest & unemployment rates:</h6>
    <p> "During periods of strong economic growth and falling unemployment, the Federal 
        Reserve is more likely to raise interest rates to cool wage growth and keep a lid 
        on potential inflation. However, officials are more likely to lower rates 
        during periods of weakening economic activity and rising unemployment to spur 
        economic growth."
